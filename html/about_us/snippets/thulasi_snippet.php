    Engineering at the University of Guelph. Looking back at my last 5 years as an undergraduate student, I'm glad 
    to say its been quite the experiencing learning how to learn, and go from a very newbie programmer to someone who 
    is now confident about taking on more complex problems and hoping to one day develop and own my own larger systems. 
    As for now, I am here for the journey, and stoked to get started on building this platform for users to come and 
    challenge themselves through a set of computer science games. I am hoping this platform is a hidden gem for those 
    like me who are visual learners and looking to stretch their problem solving skills!";
