        <h1>The Investment Banker</h1>
        <p class="justify">
            An investment banker involved in various unethical and illegal activities 
            who abuses his money and power to avoid all forms of legal repercussions. 
            That being said, his charges mainly include manipulating the market, 
            embezzlement of funds, bribery, loan sharking, and various other forms of 
            bank or market financial schemes. He doesn't seem to be involved with the 
            underground to the level of kidnapping and nor does he seem to be of that 
            type.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            Most recently, he has seized land from farmers due to the farmer’s inability 
            to pay off a loan with him, most likely through some form of unfair contract 
            or legal loophole. With this in mind, it can be concluded that this individual 
            is probably not involved with the kidnapping or the list of missing individuals 
            that was found on the farmer’s computer like the food safety department 
            initially thought. Since the farmers most likely hate this individual due to 
            being cheated. That being said, however, I believe there is more to this 
            situation than we initially thought.
