        Hi there! My name is Ivan Odiel Magtangob. Iâ€™m a fifth-year Software Engineering (Co-op) student attending the University of Guelph. A hobbyist musician and video game lover, I fell in love with the art of programming back in high school and have since used code as a medium to express my creativity through a variety of personal projects.
